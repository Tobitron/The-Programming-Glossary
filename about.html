The goal of this website is to help beginning programmers get their heads around the jargon-y, perplexing, clunky world of programming vocabulary. I had trouble with this when I started out and hope clear, approachable writing will be helpful. You may notice that many of the definitions are complete in a technical sense. They are simplified. I'm striving to convey the core of the concepts, not necessarily every nuance. So if you're a beginner using this guide, I'd suggest coming back to these definitions once you're comfortable with the basics and ready to dive a few layers deeper.
