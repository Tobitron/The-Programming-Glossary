# The-Programming-Glossary
A glossary for beginning programmers.

When I started out, I had a lot of trouble following the jargon-filled explanations of computer programmers. Technical language is important, and essential for a coder to learn. This project sets out to give beginners a clear, simple place to start. These definitions do not mean to be complete in any way, or even particularly nuanced. They are meant to give beginners enough context to move forward, they are encouraged to revisit these concepts at a later time and understand them on a deeper level.

If you see any definitions you disagree with, or would like to contribute, please submit a PR!
